  problem="Teams working with epics, stories, and subtasks expect priorities to stay aligned across the hierarchy. When a product manager reorders epics on a board, the child stories and tasks should reflect that priority shift. But Jira has no native rank cascading — each level of the hierarchy maintains its own independent ranking. The result is constant misalignment between what leadership prioritizes and what teams actually work on."
  painPoints={[
    'Manual effort: Product managers and scrum masters spend time manually re-ranking child issues every time parent priorities change.',
    'Priority drift: Without automatic cascading, child issue rankings diverge from parent priorities over days and sprints, leading to misalignment.',
    `Misleading dashboards: Reports and dashboards that aggregate across hierarchy levels show inconsistent data when ranks don't cascade.`,
    `Cross-team confusion: When multiple teams share epics, each team's board reflects different priorities because child ranks are independent.`,
  ]}
  solutionIntro="We saw this problem repeatedly in agile consulting: teams frustrated by the gap between strategic priorities and tactical execution order. Jira's ranking system works great within a single board but falls apart across the hierarchy. That's why we built Rank Cascading — to automatically propagate rank changes from parent to child issues based on board position, status, and swimlane rules."
  keyFeatures={[
    'Automatic Rank Propagation: When a parent issue is re-ranked, child issues automatically adjust their rank to match the new priority order.',
    'Board-Aware Calculation: Rank is computed based on actual board position, status columns, and swimlane configuration — not just the raw rank field.',
    'Configurable Cascading Rules: Define how deep cascading goes, which issue types participate, and which boards trigger updates.',
    'Real-Time Updates: Rank changes propagate immediately when the board is reordered, keeping backlogs synchronized at all times.',
    'Multi-Board Support: Works across multiple boards and projects, ensuring consistent priorities even in scaled agile setups.',
    'Audit Log: Track every rank change with timestamps and trigger context — know exactly when and why a rank was updated.',
