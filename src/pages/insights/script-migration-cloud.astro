  problem="Organizations running Jira Server or Data Center often rely heavily on ScriptRunner, SIL, or custom Groovy scripts to automate workflows. When migrating to Cloud, these scripts are completely incompatible — Jira Cloud doesn't support Groovy, and the ScriptRunner Cloud version has a fundamentally different API. With dozens to hundreds of scripts per instance, this becomes the single biggest blocker for cloud migration."
  painPoints={[
    `Complete incompatibility: Groovy scripts, ScriptRunner listeners, and SIL programs simply don't run in Jira Cloud. There's no automatic conversion path.`,
    'Slow, expensive manual rewriting: Each script must be analyzed, understood, and rewritten for Jira Automation or Forge — typically taking hours per script.',
    'Error-prone process: Manual conversion introduces bugs, especially for complex scripts with conditional logic, custom field access, or JQL queries.',
    'Migration timeline at risk: Script conversion often takes longer than the entire rest of the migration, delaying go-live by weeks or months.',
  ]}
  solutionIntro="After spending countless consulting hours manually converting scripts, we realized the patterns were highly repeatable. That's why we built Alchemist — a deterministic conversion engine that uses 1,300+ regex-based patterns to translate scripts into Jira Automation rules or Forge equivalents. No AI, no hallucination, just reliable pattern matching."
  keyFeatures={[
    '1,300+ Conversion Patterns: Deterministic regex-based rules covering ScriptRunner, SIL, and Groovy syntax — continuously expanded.',
    'Risk Score Assessment: Each script gets a conversion confidence score, so you know which scripts convert cleanly and which need manual review.',
    'No AI Hallucination: Pure pattern matching means the output is predictable and verifiable — unlike LLM-based conversion tools.',
    'Batch Processing: Upload and convert dozens of scripts at once, with individual reports for each conversion.',
    'Detailed Conversion Report: Line-by-line breakdown showing what was converted, what was flagged, and what needs manual attention.',
    'Export to Jira Automation: Generates ready-to-import Jira Automation rule definitions for straightforward conversions.',
